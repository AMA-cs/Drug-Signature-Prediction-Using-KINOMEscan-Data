The assay has three components: a kinase-tagged phage, a test compound, and an immobilized ligand that the compound competes with to displace the kinase. The amount of kinase bound to the immobilized ligand is determined using quantitative PCR of the DNA tag.  Results for each kinase are reported as ""Percent of control"", where the control is DMSO and where a 100% result means no inhibition of kinase binding to the ligand in the presence of the compound, and where low percent results mean strong inhibition. The KINOMEscan data are presented graphically on TREEspot Kinase Dendrograms (http://www.kinomescan.com/Tools---Resources/Study-Reports---Data-Analysis).  For this study, HMS LINCS investigators have graphed results for kinases classified as 35 ""percent of control"" (in the presence of the compound, the kinase is 35% as active for binding ligand in the presence of DMSO), 5 ""percent of control"" and 1 ""percent of control"".","KINOMEscan website: <a href = ""http://www.discoverx.com/technologies-platforms/competitive-binding-technology/kinomescan-technology-platform"" target=""blank"">Overview & Assay Principle</a><br />
